# theBLOG

This project is a Content Management System (CMS)-style blog site, where developers can publish their own blog posts and comment on others' posts. It allows users to register, log in, and interact with the community. The application is built from scratch using the Model-View-Controller (MVC) paradigm, utilizing Handlebars.js for the front-end, Sequelize ORM for database management, and Express.js for the server-side functionality. Authentication is managed using the express-session package to allow user-specific interactions, such as posting and commenting.
